###Chatgpt Prompt to create PLANNING.md and TASK.md...

I need your help with the high level direction and initial tasks. First, search for information on creating a small model training to use for TensorFLow.js detection. Then search for information about the overall PWA architecture.

Then create a PLANNING.md and TASK.md file.

PLANNING.md - high level direction, scope, tech etc.
TASK.md - intital tasks to knock out for the project.




##Initial Prompt




Using the links in @REFERENCES.json create a javascript PWA as per @PLANNING.md 

After doing so update @TASK.md since you have done the initial implementation.
